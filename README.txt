Hello, this is a project based learning experience that i am starting.

The purpose of this project is to further my understanding and capabilities in computer science and software technologies. Mainly, as of now, the two main technologies utilized for this project will be React.js for frontend and Django (Python) for backend.
I am not decided yet if a database management system (DMS) will be implemented, I will see as this project grows. However, if i do chose to do so; it will be using the SQL language with mySQL DMS.

The Fast-Food project is a web based application where users can create an order to buy food. Essentially , users will be able to create, read, update and delete an order (CRUD operations)
